Please refer to [this page](https://github.com/cabarranco/Lavoro/new/main/AppuntiVari/guide/setting_up_dev_container.md) for instructions on setting up a python environment.

Once your environment is created you'll need to install cookiecutter

```{code}

Cookiecutter can be used to generate a new repository based on this template using
